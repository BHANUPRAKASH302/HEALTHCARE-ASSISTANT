Explanation of the our Project with our website:-
So our project is about healthcare assistant where patient can directly have the contact with the doctor independent to the platform. Our website also includes automation where the meeting are conducted.
so your website consist of 3 different interfaces that are:-
1)Patient Interface
2)Doctor's Interface
3)Admin Interface.
Patient interface where we can see the group of doctors and if we want we can book an appointment with them.
Doctor's interface where the doctor can see the his upcoming patients if required he/she may contact the patients.
Admin interface where the admin can manage each and every thing like appointments, earning and addition of the doctor's.
As we continue developing our website, we are incorporating Neural Networks and DBMS, including:
ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
DBMS (Database Management System)
i) ANN: Used for identifying a person based on their previous hospital records stored in the DBMS.
ii) DBMS: Responsible for storing and managing all patient health records efficiently.
iii) CNN: Helps in disease identification through the analysis of air inhalation and exhalation of oxygen and carbon dioxide using Ultra HD video footage. By applying a series of convolution and pooling layers to
an input image or video, we can process up to 2 million input nodes. Even with a hidden layer of 64 nodes, this method allows us to accurately detect diseases. Based on this analysis, our website will facilitate
direct communication between patients and doctors for one-on-one consultations.
